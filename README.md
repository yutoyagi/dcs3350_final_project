# Analysing the effectiveness of Soft vs Hard lockdown using three network models

Yuto Yagi and Evren Uras (2020)

This project is part of final project for DCS3350 Contagion class (2021 Spring) at Bowdoin College.
This project analyzes the effectiveness, alongside costs, of hard and soft lockdowns to combat the propagation of COVID-19. Through a series of computational simulations using three major network models; Watts Strogartz Network, Barabasi Albert Network, and Erdos Renyi Network.
